\paragraph{Parameters}

\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=1.1in]
    \item[{\sf w}]    ({\sf INOUT}) An existing GraphBLAS vector.  On input,
    the vector provides values that may be accumulated with the result of the

    \item[{\sf mask}] ({\sf IN}) An optional ``write'' mask that controls which
    results from this operation are stored into the output vector {\sf w}. The

    {\sf mask} vector must be of type {\sf bool} or any of the predefined 
    ``built-in'' types in Table~\ref{Tab:PredefinedTypes}.  If the default

    {\sf GrB\_NULL} should be specified.

    \item[{\sf accum}] ({\sf IN}) An optional binary operator used for accumulating

\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=2.2in]
    \item[{\sf GrB\_SUCCESS}]         In blocking mode, the operation completed

    dimensions are incompatible.

    \item[{\sf GrB\_DOMAIN\_MISMATCH}]    The domains of the various vectors are
    incompatible with the corresponding domains of the accumulation operator
    or index unary operator, or the mask's domain is not compatible with {\sf bool}
    (in the case where {\sf desc[GrB\_MASK].GrB\_STRUCTURE} is not set).
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Description}

{\color{red}
This variant of {\sf GrB\_select} computes the result of applying a index unary operator
to select the elements of the input GraphBLAS vector.  The operator takes, as input,
the value of each stored element, along with the element's index and a scalar 
constant -- either {\sf val} or {\sf s}.  The corresponding element of the input vector is selected (kept)
if the function evaluates to {\sf true} when cast to {\sf bool}.  This acts like a
functional mask on the input vector as follows:
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=2.1in]
\item[~] ${\sf w} = {\sf u}\langle f_i({\sf u}, \bold{ind}({\sf u}), 1, {\sf val})\rangle$,
\end{itemize}
or if an optional binary accumulation operator ($\odot$) is provided:
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=2.1in]
\item[~] ${\sf w} = {\sf w} \odot {\sf u}\langle f_i({\sf u}, \bold{ind}({\sf u}), 1, {\sf val})\rangle$.  
\end{itemize}
Note that if an index unary operator is provided that expects two indices {\it and} 
accesses the second index the results are undefined.}

Logically, this operation occurs in three steps:
\begin{enumerate}[leftmargin=0.75in]
\item[\bf Setup] The internal vectors and mask used in the computation are formed 
and their domains and dimensions are tested for compatibility.
\item[\bf Compute] The indicated computations are carried out.
\item[\bf Output] The result is written into the output vector, possibly under 
control of a mask.
\end{enumerate}

Up to three argument vectors are used in this {\sf GrB\_select} operation:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item ${\sf w} = \langle \bold{D}({\sf w}),\bold{size}({\sf w}),
    \bold{L}({\sf w}) = \{(i,w_i) \} \rangle$

    \item ${\sf mask} = \langle \bold{D}({\sf mask}),\bold{size}({\sf mask}),
    \bold{L}({\sf mask}) = \{(i,m_i) \} \rangle$ (optional)

    \item ${\sf u} = \langle \bold{D}({\sf u}),\bold{size}({\sf u}),
    \bold{L}({\sf u}) = \{(i,u_i) \} \rangle$
\end{enumerate}

{\color{red}
The argument scalar, vectors, index unary operator and the accumulation 
operator (if provided) are tested for domain compatibility as follows:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item If {\sf mask} is not {\sf GrB\_NULL}, and ${\sf desc[GrB\_MASK].GrB\_STRUCTURE}$
    is not set, then $\bold{D}({\sf mask})$ must be from one of the pre-defined types of 
    Table~\ref{Tab:PredefinedTypes}.

    \item If {\sf accum} is not {\sf GrB\_NULL}, then $\bold{D}({\sf w})$ must be 
	compatible with $\bold{D}({\sf u})$.

    \item If {\sf accum} is not {\sf GrB\_NULL}, then $\bold{D}({\sf w})$ must be
    compatible with $\bDin1({\sf accum})$ and $\bDout({\sf accum})$ of the accumulation operator and 
    $\bold{D}({\sf u})$ must be compatible with $\bDin2({\sf accum})$ of the accumulation operator.

	\item $\bDout({\sf op})$ of the index unary operator must be from one of the pre-defined types of 
    Table~\ref{Tab:PredefinedTypes}; i.e., castable to {\sf bool}.

    \item $\bold{D}({\sf u})$ must be compatible with $\bDin1({\sf op})$ of the index unary operator.
    
    \item $\bold{D}({\sf val})$ must be compatible with $\bDin2({\sf op})$ of the index unary operator.
\end{enumerate}
}
Two domains are compatible with each other if values from one domain can be cast 
to values in the other domain as per the rules of the C language.
In particular, domains from Table~\ref{Tab:PredefinedTypes} are all compatible 
with each other. A domain from a user-defined type is only compatible with itself.
If any compatibility rule above is violated, execution of {\sf GrB\_select} ends
and the domain mismatch error listed above is returned.

From the argument vectors, the internal vectors and mask used in 
the computation are formed ($\leftarrow$ denotes copy):
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Vector $\vector{\widetilde{w}} \leftarrow {\sf w}$.

    \item One-dimensional mask, $\vector{\widetilde{m}}$, is computed from 
    argument {\sf mask} as follows:
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item If ${\sf mask} = {\sf GrB\_NULL}$, then $\vector{\widetilde{m}} = 
        \langle \bold{size}({\sf w}), \{i, \ \forall \ i : 0 \leq i < 
        \bold{size}({\sf w}) \} \rangle$.

        \item If {\sf mask} $\ne$ {\sf GrB\_NULL},  
        \begin{enumerate}
            \item If ${\sf desc[GrB\_MASK].GrB\_STRUCTURE}$ is set, then
            $\vector{\widetilde{m}} = 
            \langle \bold{size}({\sf mask}), \{i : i \in \bold{ind}({\sf mask}) \} \rangle$,
            \item Otherwise, $\vector{\widetilde{m}} = 
            \langle \bold{size}({\sf mask}), \{i : i \in \bold{ind}({\sf mask}) \wedge
            ({\sf bool}){\sf mask}(i) = \true \} \rangle$.
        \end{enumerate}

        \item    If ${\sf desc[GrB\_MASK].GrB\_COMP}$ is set, then 
        $\vector{\widetilde{m}} \leftarrow \neg \vector{\widetilde{m}}$.
    \end{enumerate}

    \item Vector $\vector{\widetilde{u}} \leftarrow {\sf u}$.
\end{enumerate}

The internal vectors and masks are checked for dimension compatibility. 
The following conditions must hold:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item $\bold{size}(\vector{\widetilde{w}}) = \bold{size}(\vector{\widetilde{m}})$
    \item $\bold{size}(\vector{\widetilde{u}}) = \bold{size}(\vector{\widetilde{w}})$.
\end{enumerate}
If any compatibility rule above is violated, execution of {\sf GrB\_select} ends and 
the dimension mismatch error listed above is returned.

From this point forward, in {\sf GrB\_NONBLOCKING} mode, the method can 
optionally exit with {\sf GrB\_SUCCESS} return code and defer any computation 
and/or execution error codes.

We are now ready to carry out the {\sf select} and any additional 
associated operations.  We describe this in terms of two intermediate vectors:
\begin{itemize}
    \item $\vector{\widetilde{t}}$: The vector holding the result from applying the index unary operator to the input vector
    $\vector{\widetilde{u}}$.
    \item $\vector{\widetilde{z}}$: The vector holding the result after 
    application of the (optional) accumulation operator.
\end{itemize}

{\color{red}
The intermediate vector, $\vector{\widetilde{t}}$, is created as follows:
\[
\vector{\widetilde{t}} = \langle
\bold{D}({\sf u}), \bold{size}(\vector{\widetilde{u}}),
\bold{L}(\vector{\widetilde{t}}) =
\{(i,\vector{\widetilde{u}}(i), : i \in \bold{ind}(\vector{\widetilde{u}}) \wedge ({\sf bool})f_i(\vector{\widetilde{u}}(i),i,{\sf val}) = \true \} \rangle,
\]
where $f_{i} = \mathbf{f}({\sf op})$. \scott{add another zero index argument for j above?}

The argument scalar, matrices, index unary operator and the accumulation

Two domains are compatible with each other if values from one domain can be cast 
to values in the other domain as per the rules of the C language.
In particular, domains from Table~\ref{Tab:PredefinedTypes} are all compatible 
with each other. A domain from a user-defined type is only compatible with itself.
If any compatibility rule above is violated, execution of {\sf GrB\_select} ends and 
the domain mismatch error listed above is returned.

    argument {\sf Mask} as follows:

            ({\sf bool}){\sf Mask}(i,j) = \true\} \rangle$.
        \end{enumerate}

        \item    If ${\sf desc[GrB\_MASK].GrB\_COMP}$ is set, then 
        $\matrix{\widetilde{M}} \leftarrow \neg \matrix{\widetilde{M}}$.
    \end{enumerate}

    \item Matrix $\matrix{\widetilde{A}}$ is computed from argument {\sf A} as 
    follows: 
    \begin{itemize}[leftmargin=1.2in]
    \item[bind-first:~~~~]  $\matrix{\widetilde{A}}\leftarrow
        {\sf desc[GrB\_INP1].GrB\_TRAN} \ ? \ {\sf A}^T : {\sf A}$
    \item[bind-second:~~~~] $\matrix{\widetilde{A}}\leftarrow
        {\sf desc[GrB\_INP0].GrB\_TRAN} \ ? \ {\sf A}^T : {\sf A}$
    \end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}

The internal matrices and mask are checked for dimension compatibility. 
The following conditions must hold:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item $\bold{nrows}(\matrix{\widetilde{C}}) = \bold{nrows}(\matrix{\widetilde{M}})$.

    \item $\bold{ncols}(\matrix{\widetilde{C}}) = \bold{ncols}(\matrix{\widetilde{M}})$.

    \item $\bold{nrows}(\matrix{\widetilde{C}}) = \bold{nrows}(\matrix{\widetilde{A}})$.

    \item $\bold{ncols}(\matrix{\widetilde{C}}) = \bold{ncols}(\matrix{\widetilde{A}})$.
\end{enumerate}
If any compatibility rule above is violated, execution of {\sf GrB\_select} ends and 
the dimension mismatch error listed above is returned.

From this point forward, in {\sf GrB\_NONBLOCKING} mode, the method can optionally exit
with {\sf GrB\_SUCCESS} return code and defer any computation and/or execution error codes.

We are now ready to carry out the select and any additional 
associated operations.  We describe this in terms of two intermediate matrices:
\begin{itemize}
    \item $\matrix{\widetilde{T}}$: The matrix holding the result from applying the index unary operator to the input matrix
    $\matrix{\widetilde{A}}$.

    \item $\matrix{\widetilde{Z}}$: The matrix holding the result after 
    application of the (optional) accumulation operator.
\end{itemize}

{\color{red}
The intermediate matrix, $\matrix{\widetilde{T}}$, is created as follows:
\[
\begin{aligned}
\matrix{\widetilde{T}} = \langle & \bDout({\sf op}),
                           \bold{nrows}(\matrix{\widetilde{C}}), 
                           \bold{ncols}(\matrix{\widetilde{C}}), \\
						  & \bold{L}(\matrix{\widetilde{T}}) =
    \{(i,j,\matrix{\widetilde{A}}(i,j) : {i,j} \in \bold{ind}(\matrix{\widetilde{A}}) 
	\wedge
({\sf bool})f_{i,j}(\matrix{\widetilde{A}}(i,j),i,j,{\sf val}) = \true \} \rangle,
\end{aligned}
\]
where $f_{i,j} = \mathbf{f}({\sf op})$.
